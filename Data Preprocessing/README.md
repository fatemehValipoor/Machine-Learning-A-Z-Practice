# 📁 Preprocessing

This folder contains the code and dataset used for **data preprocessing**, which is a crucial first step in any machine learning project.

## 📄 Files

- `DATA_PREPROCESSING_TOOLS.ipynb`:  
  This Python script performs the following preprocessing tasks:
  - Importing the dataset
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical data
  - Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
  - Feature scaling

- `Data.csv`:  
  The sample dataset used for preprocessing.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this step is to clean and prepare the data so that it can be effectively used in machine learning models such as regression, classification, or clustering.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (`sklearn`)

## 🚀 Next Steps

This is the first step in my machine learning journey. After preprocessing, I plan to explore:
- Regression algorithms
- Classification models
- Clustering techniques
- And more...

Stay tuned!
